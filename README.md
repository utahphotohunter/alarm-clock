# alarm-clock

This program is a web based alarm clock. A user can set an alarm time and the alarm will go off based on that time. The user can change the alarm sound to a new random sound to add variety to the alarm. A code must be entered to deactivate the alarm.

The site can be configured to send the user to a url upon the alarm deactivation.
