# alarm-clock

This program is a web based alarm clock. A user can set an alarm time and the alarm will go off based on that time. The sound of the alarm is randomly selected every time the alarm activates. Once the alarm deactivates, the user is redirected to a list of news stories based on their preferences that can be set the first time the user engages with the program.
