# alarm-clock

This program is a web based alarm clock. It is designed to be opened by a python script at a specific time. The alarm will activate once the site is loaded if the time window in the js script for the alarm is active. A code must be entered to deactivate the alarm.

The site can be configured to send the user to a url upon the alarm deactivation.
